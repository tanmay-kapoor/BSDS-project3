# Assignment Overview

Overall, I learned more about distributed systems, data consistency, transaction management and
implementing the 2 phase commit protocol. The 2 phase commit protocol taught me the importance of
reaching a consensus before committing a transaction, ensuring reliability and synchronization
across servers. I also gained insights into designing fault-tolerant systems to handle potential
failures in a distributed environment. Overall, the assignment deepened my understanding of
distributed systems and the significance of the 2 phase commit protocol in achieving data
consistency.

# Technical Impression

Below are some of the key learnings I gained from this project.

### Distributed Systems Complexity

- Working with multiple servers and clients in a distributed environment highlighted the challenges
  of managing coordination and communication between nodes.
- Understanding the intricacies of message passing, remote method invocation, and data
  synchronization across the network was crucial.

### Transaction Management Importance

- Realizing the significance of transaction management in distributed systems to ensure data
  consistency and reliability.
- Recognizing the need for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties to
  handle concurrent operations effectively.

### 2 Phase Commit Protocol

- Implementing the 2 phase commit protocol provided insights into ensuring distributed transactional
  integrity.
- Learning about the two main phases: prepare and commit, where all servers reach consensus before
  committing the transaction.

### Data Synchronization

- Understanding the mechanisms required to synchronize data across all servers whenever a request is
  sent to any server.
- Grasping the challenges of maintaining consistency when dealing with concurrent read and write
  operations.

### Robustness and Reliability

- Emphasizing the importance of creating a robust system to handle various scenarios, ensuring data
  integrity even during unexpected events.
- Implementing error detection, error recovery mechanisms, and data replication to enhance
  reliability.
